# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The closest [minor version][] will always be supported. On migration to the
next minor version, the previous minor version will immediately no longer
get vulnerability support and users are expected to update to the latest
version. Migration instructions will always be provided, so this should be
trivial.

Major versions are infrequent, but if one occurs, the goal is to support
the major version with a scew of -1 for 3 months. Afterwards, based on
popularity of the old major version, a decision will be made public as to
the duration of vulnerability support going forth.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report any vulnerabilities to louislefebvre1999@gmail.com with your GitHub 
username and how you discovered the vulnerability. By reaching out to me, I
will include your username in the pull request to review and expect you will
be available to review.

Thanks for your support!
