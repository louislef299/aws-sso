## aws-sso completion bash

Generate the autocompletion script for bash

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(aws-sso completion bash)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	aws-sso completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/aws-sso

#### macOS:

	aws-sso completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/aws-sso

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
aws-sso completion bash
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for bash
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --as string               Username to impersonate for the operation. User could be a regular user or a service account in a namespace.
      --as-group stringArray    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
      --commandTimeout string   the default timeout for network commands executed (default "3s")
```
