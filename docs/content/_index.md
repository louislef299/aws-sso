Welcome and thanks for trying out my authentication tool. Below is information
for getting started with `aws-sso`. If you are experiencing any problems and
need to reach out to [me][], plz go ahead and [create an issue][] and I'll try
to get back as soon as possible.

For releases, you can find important notes per release in the [official release
notes][] and the `--help` flag is your friend. There's no release schedule, but
I try to at least deploy dependency fixes once a month.

Happy hacking!
